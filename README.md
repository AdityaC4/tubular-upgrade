# Project4

- Aditya Chaudhari


I have completed extra credit
1. Recursive Functions
3. Make the `:string` type casing work on integers


For my testing I also added 3 new tests:
1. test 21: to check recursive function (Fibonacci sequence)
2. test 22: testing `:string` type casting
3. test 23: testing string compare using `==`
4. test 24: testing recursive function calls with strings (ReverseString)
